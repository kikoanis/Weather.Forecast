## To Build in CLI
navigate to project main folder and then run
```
dotnet build
```

## To Run in CLI

```
dotnet run --project .\src\Weather.Forecast.Web\Weather.Forecast.Web.csproj
```

Then you can access the API/ swagger at localhost:5000

Edit launchSettings.json if you need to use another port than 5000

## Alternatively, the solution can be opened in Visual Studio and run within (debug or relase mode)
